TravelPal
=========
TravelPal was built during the Emirates hachathon(http://www.emirateshackathon.com/), Sep. 21-22, 2013.

It was built by Ching-Lun Lin, David Lee, and Jeff Hsu. Jeff worked for web UI, David worked for database, and I built the mobile part. This is the mobile part of the application.

The development hasn't stoped after the hackathon. I have been improving the architecture and interface.

Please feel free to contact me for further information.
